     <h3>Become an Internet Sleuth</h3>
     <p>There are ways to figure out if the site you're on is a reputable one. First, look at the domain name and the extension. Ever notice that most sites have '.com' or '.org' at the end? These actually mean something.</p>
     <p>Below is a list of the most common domain name extensions and their meanings:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>.com stands for a commercial site. So, if you land on a .com page, that site may have an agenda beyond providing you with information, such as selling a product.</li>
        <li>.net stands for Internet source. Again, these sites can be excellent resources, but they can also be unreliable.</li>
        <li>.edu stands for university or school. These are usually reliable resources.</li>
        <li>.gov this stands for the government. These are also usually reliable resources.</li>
       
     </ul>
    <h3>Nutrition and Weight Loss</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: This should be the first place you go for reliable nutrition information. Brush up on your food pyramid knowledge, or check out their healthy lifestyle tips.</li>
      <li>Nutrition at Verywell: We have some great resources for eating healthy and losing weight.</li>
      <li>Weight Loss at Verywell: We focus on diets and healthy eating to help you learn simple ways to cut calories and lose weight.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Medical/Health</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>CDC.gov: The site for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has all the latest information about diseases, conditions, illnesses, injuries, and health.</li>
      <li>American Heart Association: This is the official website of the AHA and covers all aspects of heart disease, stroke, and general health and fitness.</li>
      <li>American Medical Association: If you want information about a specific condition, illness or injury, search through this information site for a wealth of information.</li>
    </ul>
